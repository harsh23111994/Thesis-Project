# Thesis-Project
Forecasting the Novel Corona (COVID-19) virus using Time Series Model

# Technologies Used: 
Python3, MS Excel

# Research Question
"Can machine learning algorithms like Time series model accurately predict the impact of COVID-19 in India at early stages ?"

# Project Brief
* The Thesis project was successfully implemented with its primary objective to accurately forecast the reported cases of COVID-19. 
* Additional work was done to extract the key symptoms that show early signs of a person being affected by a virus or not ?
* LSTM model outperformed the other models(ARIMA, ARMA, and Prophet) with the least error values for RMSE, MSE, and MAPE along with a maximum R2 of 0.9997.
* Timeseries models are capable of predicting other factors apart from COVID-19 reported cases like predicting the sales of the product. 
* The key takeaway from this research project is that not all datasets stationary in nature and need to be treated differently as per the situation. 
* Future scope for this project is how to efficiently predict the cases without using Neural network models and refining the time series models (ARIMA and ARMA).
